# Periodic Table Jetpack Compose
_I before made the [Periodic Table](https://github.com/beyrakIn/Periodic-Table) app in Java now I want to update it because it is so amateur and contains some bug/incorrect code in particular. I want to remake it at Kotlin & Jetpack Compose. In a day I finished the main part of the application but it does not ready yet. Actually, I do have not enough time to do this. There is a couple of application incompleted. I will finish all of them. But I have no idea when :). If you are an android developer, you can help me to develop these apps (if you want)._



I used [Periodium](https://periodum.com/) API endpoints for this application as you can see. If you want to see the source of this information, you can visit their [website](https://periodum.com/).
